detect rust
# what is rust:   
#Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air #moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. #Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides Fe2O
#  I2C
#I2C is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A #converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems. It was invented by Philips and now it is used by #almost all major IC manufacturers.

#2/11/17  Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) 
# the ultimate way to  do this detection is  nondestructively.   we want to check for rust without penetrating thru
the metal (which can ultimately start the erosion process)
# proposed method of doing this is still being developed   by    SVI( Software Variations) hardware team.



#SPI
#    Image result for what is spi
#    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small #peripherals such as shift registers, sensors, and SD cards. It uses separate clock and data lines, along with a select line to #choose the device you wish to talk to.
